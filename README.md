# Eva-App

It's a prototype of an Android app that comes with modernised cigarette bin. The idea is that to keep the cities clean, the local governments should incentivise smokers to use cigarette bins. This app would be used for collecting points for using the bin. After gathering 10 points, a discount for a service or a product in local business would be added to the list. Hence, it would benefit local aesthetics and economy.

The bin would be equipped with some form of cigarette detection and NFC module. The app uses NFC module of the phone to collect the points and it was successfully tested with NFC tags. For other testing purpuses a click on the counter allows to increase the count but it would be disabled in final product. Also, the discount view is currently empty as ultimately it would show a barcode generated to work with systems of the businesses in the program.
